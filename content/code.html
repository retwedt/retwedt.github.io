<h1>HTML &amp; JavaScript Projects</h1>
<p>These projects were built as part of the curriculum for CodeAbode, a coding bootcamp in Chicago.  CodeAbode focused on teaching the fundamentals of web programming using the most up-to-date technologies: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" target="_blank" >Node.js.</a></p>

<h2>HTML Demos</h2>
<p>These HTML demos are from the Intro to Modern Web Design course.  These demos were intended to help students put all the pieces of their new knowledge together and create a functioning web page with a thought-out design.</p>

<p>The Star Wars fan site is an example of a final project students would complete during the Web Design course.  This site demonstrates use of the HTML and CSS elements learned by the students, as well as more advanced techniques like column layouts and CSS transitions.</p>

<h2>Canvas Demos</h2>
<p><em>Space Battle</em> was built as part of an Introduction to JavaScript Games course at CodeAbode.  <em>Space Battle</em> utilizes the new <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_canvas.asp" target="_blank" >HTML5 Canvas element</a>.  This element makes it easy to create graphics that can be controlled using JavaScript.</p>

<p>The Particle demo, from the JavaScript course, uses the HTML5 canvas element and the JavaScript library P5.js.  This project demonstrates use of constructor functions, and their ability to make complex pieces of code reusable.</p>

<h2>APIs</h2>
<p>The Movie Pal app, from the Advanced JavaScript course, was the students first attempt at practically using an API.  We took advantage of the <a href="http://www.omdbapi.com/" target="_blank" >OMDB Api</a>, a free service giving access to movie information, ratings, and posters.  This project was expanded on using the <a href="http://handlebarsjs.com/" target="_blank" >Handlebars templating engine</a> and <a href="https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/" target="_blank" >Animate.css</a>, an easy to use CSS animation library.</p>
<p><a href="http://rextwedt.com/movie-search-template/" target="_blank" >Movie Pal</a></p>
<p>In the Server-Side Programming course, students built their own API's.  This app uses a pirate translation api to translate regular english into "pirate-speak."  Thar she blows!</p>

<h2>Multi-User Apps (w/Sockets)</h2>
<p>The Server-Side Programming course used Node.js, a framework allowing JavaScript to be used server-side as well as client-side.  <a href="http://socket.io/" target="_blank" >Socket.io</a> is a library that makes it easy to use websockets for real-time communication.</p>
<p>The Multi-User Chat app uses Node.js and Socket.io to create a real-time chat app.  Users enter a unique id when they first join the page, and can communicate with any other user in the chat room.  New users can see a list of people currently in the chat room, as well as recent chat history.</p>

<p>The Multi-User Drawing App uses sockets in a slightly different way.  Rather than sending text, the websockets communicate canvas drawing coordinates.  Each user can draw on the same canvas to create a collaborative masterpiece.</p>

<p>The Ultimate Drawing App combines the two previous projects, creating a collaborative drawing environment with multiple colors, and the ability to communicate with other users in the chat room.</p>
