<h1>Hand Augmented Reality Application (H.A.R.A.)</h1>
<h2>Graduate Reasearch Project</h2>
<p>Educators have recognized that traditional methods of teaching anatomy can be slow, expensive, and inefficient.  A variety of new methods for teaching anatomy are emerging.  HARA is an augmented reality learning app for mobile devices.  The app detects a display with a 3D printed model, and displays 3D models of the relevant anatomy, in the proper scale, position, and orientation.  HARA focuses on the human hand, due to its complexity, frequent usage, and high rate of injury and disease.</p>
<p>I used the game engine Unity3d as a framework for developing HARA.  Game engines have several advantages for complex visualizations, including a built-in graphics engine, the ability to render complex models, and the ability to publish to multiple platforms.  I used the plug-in Vuforia to add augmented reality functionality to my app.  Vuforia allowed me to customize image targets to create the final display for my project.</p>

<p>Patient data was utilized when creating the 3D surface models for HARA.  Models were based on the National Library of Medicineâ€™s Visible Human Male (VHM) digital patient dataset, made available by the National Museum of Health + Medicine Chicago.  These rough models then had to be optimized for use with a mobile device.  Each model was retopologized to have a minimal number of polygons, while maintaining any important landmarks.</p>
<p>The models were painted and sculpted to look as real as possible.  These details could then be projected onto the optimized models in Unity3d using texture maps and normal maps.  A user-interface was created to allow users to switch between models, and see the name of any model that is touched.  The final app was built for Android and IOS devices.  The final display for the app includes a 3d printed model of the hand.  When a user looks at the display, the app appears to be looking inside of the hand.</p>
